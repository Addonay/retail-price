# ML Project

## Description
This project is a machine learning project focused on demand forecasting. It includes data analysis, model training, and prediction capabilities.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have `uv` installed. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data analysis and experimentation.
- `main.py`: Python script for the data analysis and viz.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the demand forecasting application.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model and its metadata.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependency management.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `uv.lock`: Lock file for `uv` dependency management.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
  - `dataset.csv`: Main dataset for the project.
