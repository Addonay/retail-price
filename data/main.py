# ## Analysis Summary
#
# This notebook aimed to build a model to predict product demand categories (Low, Medium, High) based on various features. Here's a summary of the key steps and findings:
#
# ### Data Loading and Initial Exploration
#
# The dataset was loaded and initial checks were performed for missing values and duplicates. No missing values or duplicates were found. Descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the distribution of key features like unit price and quantity, and relationships between product categories and prices.
#
# ### Feature Engineering and Target Variable Creation
#
# New features were engineered, including price ratios compared to competitors and revenue per customer. The target variable, `demand_category`, was created by categorizing the `qty` (quantity) based on percentile thresholds. We experimented with different percentile thresholds to define these categories.
#
# ### Model Training and Evaluation
#
# Several classification models were trained and evaluated:
#
# 1.  **Decision Tree Classifier:** A Decision Tree model was chosen as a baseline due to its interpretability. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using `GridSearchCV` to find the best combination of parameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`. The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test set.
#
#     *   **Features Used:** The Decision Tree model was trained using a set of features deemed potentially relevant to predicting demand, including `unit_price`, `freight_price`, `product_score`, `customers`, time-based features (`weekday`, `weekend`, `holiday`, `month`), `volume`, competitor prices (`comp_1`, `comp_2`, `comp_3`), product characteristics (`product_weight_g`, `product_photos_qty`), and the engineered features (`price_ratio_comp1`, `price_ratio_comp2`, `cheaper_than_comp1`, `revenue_per_customer`). These features were selected based on the assumption that they could influence customer demand.
#
# 2.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A distance-based algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. Hyperparameter tuning was done using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal number of neighbors and distance metric.
#
# 3.  **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** A simple feedforward neural network (`MLPClassifier`) was implemented. `GridSearchCV` was used to tune hyperparameters like the number of hidden layers and neurons, activation function, and solver.
#
# ### Train-Validation-Test Split
#
# To ensure a robust evaluation and prevent overfitting, the dataset was split into three subsets:
#
# *   **Training Set (50%):** Used to train the models.
# *   **Validation Set (25%):** Used for hyperparameter tuning during the model development phase (implicitly used by `GridSearchCV`'s cross-validation).
# *   **Test Set (25%):** Held out until the very end for a final, unbiased evaluation of the best-performing model.
#
# ### Outlier Handling
#
# In this analysis, explicit outlier detection and removal were not performed. The models used (Decision Tree and ensemble methods like Random Forest, as well as KNN and simple ANN) are relatively robust to outliers compared to some other algorithms (like linear models). However, depending on the data and the chosen model, outlier handling could be a consideration for future improvement.
#
# ### Model Comparison
#
# Based on the evaluation metrics calculated on the test set, the models were compared:
#
# [Insert Model Comparison Table Here - *refer to the generated Polars table output*]
#
# Looking at the comparison table (from the executed cell), the **Decision Tree Classifier** currently shows the best performance across the key metrics like Test Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score compared to the KNN and MLPClassifier models.
#
# ### Why Decision Tree Appears Better
#
# Several factors might contribute to the Decision Tree performing better in this case:
#
# *   **Interpretability and Feature Importance:** The Decision Tree's ability to identify and utilize the most important features (as seen in the feature importance analysis) might be crucial for this dataset. Features like `revenue_per_customer`, `customers`, and `unit_price` were identified as highly influential.
# *   **Non-linearity:** Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
# *   **Robustness to Feature Scaling:** Unlike KNN and some ANNs, Decision Trees are not sensitive to the scale of the features.
#
# While the Decision Tree performed best among the models tested so far, further optimization (e.g., more extensive hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering based on feature importance) could potentially improve its performance or reveal that other models could perform better with different configurations or data preprocessing.
